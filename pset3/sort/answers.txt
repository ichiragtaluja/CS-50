sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: It is because time taken by sort1 to solve the sorted5000,random10000 and random50000 was 0.031s, 0.059s and 0.717s, which
                was quite fast compared to both Random and Reversed texts. For example, time taken for random5000,random10000 and random50000 was
                0.075s, 0.318s and 8.04s. Time taken for reversed was almost as long as for random.

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: Firstly, because for all the three groups i.e. random, reversed or sorted, time taken was the sameand that was shorter
                    than sort3 by a huge margin. For example, time taken for random50000, random10000 and random50000
                    was only .046s, .076s and .838s.


sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: Because, no matter if the set was random, reversed or sorted, time took to sort for all of the sets were
                    in the same range. and especially, if the set size was larger, it was taking a huge time to get the output done.
                    for example, Reversed5000 took 0.051s whereas reversed50000 took 3.64s
